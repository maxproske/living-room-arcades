# Living Room Arcades

I'm making a 2.5D game in React without `<canvas>` as a constraint, to improve my knowledge of performance optimization in React.

## Feature Roadmap
- [X] Pathfinding

## Technology Roadmap
- [X] **Next.js** to persist game state between hot reloading. API code co-located with frontend.
- [ ] **TypeScript** to reduce type error mistakes, and create custom structs.
- [ ] **React Suspense** to display a skeleton of the map while lazy loading assets and data.
